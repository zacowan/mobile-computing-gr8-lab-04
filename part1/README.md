# Lab 4 - Part 1

## Group Members

Shaun Fidler, Sydney McLaughlin, Zach Cowan

## Code Explanation

Our 4 services and the main.cpp file for testing those services is located in
the `services/` directory. In the root directory for part 1, we have the
supporting code that is run on our pi.

## Description of Effort

All group members worked together on all aspects of the project during group
meetings. All group members planned out the hardware, hardware setup, and
services to be offered by each sensor/actuator. All group members worked on the 
creation of a proper Atlas DDL file
